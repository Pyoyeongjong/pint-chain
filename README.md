# pint-chain
## Project Overview
 **pint-chain** is a Rust-based experimental **Layer 1 blockchain node project** designed for learning purposes.  
The primary goal of this project is to understand how real-world blockchain clients operate internally by implementing a simplified Layer 1 blockchain from scratch.

 This project is heavily inspired by the architecture of the Ethereum Execution Client **reth**, and focuses on breaking down and re-implementing its core ideas in a more compact form.  
 
 pint-chain is an **account-based blockchain**, and the node is designed around a set of clearly separated core components, each with a well-defined responsibility:
- `Network`  
  Handles TCP-based P2P communication, peer management, and block/transaction propagation.
- `Consensus (BlockImporter + Miner)`  
  Responsible for chain selection, block validation, and Proof-of-Work–based mining.
- `PayloadBuilder`  
  Packages validated transactions into new block payloads.
- `Pool (TxPool + Validator)`  
  Manages transaction collection, validation, and state-based filtering.
- `Provider (StateProvider + DB)`  
  Provides an abstraction layer over block data and account state stored in the database.
- `RPC Server`  
  Exposes an HTTP-based interface for external clients to interact with the node.

The consensus algorithm is **Proof of Work (PoW)**, with a simplified difficulty adjustment rule where the difficulty is doubled or halved on every block. 

Chain selection follows the **Longest Chain Rule**, and peer discovery starts from a boot node, followed by random peer selection.

Transaction signing and verification are implemented using **ECDSA with signer recovery**, following the same model used by Ethereum.

Beyond basic functionality, this project is Validating node correctness and stability through **unit tests and end-to-end (E2E) tests**

Overall, pint-chain serves as a compact but realistic playground for experimenting with blockchain node architecture, consensus mechanics, networking, and system-level design trade-offs.

## How to use
### Run a node
```bash
cargo run -- --boot-node
cargo run -- --name A --port 30304 --rpc-port 8546 --miner-address 0534501c34f5a0f3fa43dc5d78e619be7edfa21a
```
### E2E-test
```bash
cd e2e-test
RUST_LOG=DEBUG cargo test multi -- --no-capture
```

### Rpc connectioin
Use [clients/rpc](clients/rpc) crate. 
Currently only responds with binary data (example included).

## Execution basic examples
This example uses pint-utils crates that sends test transactions.

### Boot Node
